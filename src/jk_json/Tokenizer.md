Explanation

General
-------

Tokenization is performed by a simple state machine. This machine checks or pattern in the input stream, emits tokens based on these patterns and advances to the next pattern after that. In order to have a context dependent behaviour the machine can switch modes as necessary, processing different patterns as adequate in the current context.

Processing is done by looking at a character input stream provided. Either ...

* an defined character is matched,
* one character of a set of defined characters is matched,
* a regular expression is matched, or
* any character is matched.

The basic operation

Matching Operations
-------------------

| Command					| Code	|
|---------------------------|-------|
| exact string				| 1		|
| any character of string	| 2		|
| exact regex				| 3		|
| other						| -		|

Action Operations
-----------------

In order for easy design on each element eaten one or more of these actions can be performed:

| Command				| Code	| Description																						|
|-----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| error str:xxx			| 1		| raise error message with text "xxx"																|
| advance				| 2		| the stream is advanced by the element matched														|
| mode int:xxx			| 3		| switch to table "xxx"																				|
| emitElement str:xxx	| 4		| emit a token; token type is "xxx", content is the current element matched							|
| appendElementToBuffer	| 5		| Append the current element to the buffer															|
| emitBuffer str:xxx	| 6		| emit a token; type is "xxx", content is the content of the buffer; afterwards: empty the buffer	|
| dropBuffer			| 7		| empty the buffer																					|
